## Code Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the calculator UI
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the calculator logic
- `style.css`: The CSS file that contains the calculator styles

## Calculator Logic

The calculator logic is implemented in the `script.js` file. It uses a simple state machine to keep track of the current operation and operands. The `calculate` function performs the actual calculation based on the current operation and operands.
